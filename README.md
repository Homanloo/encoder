# Very Simple Encoding-Decoding Application with Python
As one of my very first projects with python, I wrote this silly encoding-decoding app :) <br>Althogh it's, indeed, very simple and unpractical, but it's something special to me since it was very fun to see it working back in the days!<br><br>
